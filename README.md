# Mirage

## Overview
This repository is intended to keep track of the design and development of Mirage videogame, a project for the Videogame Design and Programming course at Politecnico di Milano.

## Info
Mirage is a 2D puzzle platformer about wonderful experiences that a writer encounters on his journey. The story of this game is based on a very famous Chinese novel in the Qing Dynasty in China - "Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio". The author of this novel has collected many Chinese folklore and anecdotes. Therefore, the game will also be integrated into ancient Chinese myths and legends.

The overall graphic style of the game combines elegant traditional Chinese painting style and modern illustrations with puppetry and shadow puppetry elements. Players will experience amazing scenes telling mysterious oriental stories.
